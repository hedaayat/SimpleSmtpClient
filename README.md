# SimpleSmtpClient

This simple smtp client reads host configuration from app.config file and send email to the host using smtp.

My puprose in writing this is to have a very simple code to check smtp functionality in a server without hassle. So I added some tracing to trace.log file and to the console.

Later I may add coloring to the console but the purpose here is to keep everything very very simple.
